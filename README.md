# 🗺️ Graph Shortest Path Finder (Python)

This repository contains a **single Python program** that builds a small graph of major African cities and computes the **shortest path from Lagos to Johannesburg** using a breadth-first search (BFS)–style approach.  

The work was completed as part of a **Data Structures & Algorithms** lab and is accompanied by a short **written analysis document** explaining the design and results.

## 🔍 What the Program Demonstrates

- Representation of a **graph** in Python  
- Use of an **adjacency matrix** to show connections  
- A **shortest path search** based on breadth-first traversal  
- Basic **OOP principles** (custom `Graph` class and methods)  
- Clear, readable console output

This makes it a good example of applying core algorithm and data structure concepts in a simple, practical way.
